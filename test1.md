**Markdown file** is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. *John Gruber* created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, **online forums**, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

The initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. This was addressed in 2014, when long-standing Markdown contributors released **CommonMark**, an unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown.
